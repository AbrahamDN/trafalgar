Remember to call `git pull origin master` to keep your local repository up to date.

Default styles such as font-family & element styles shall be made in the index/App.scss

## Available Scripts

## Convention rules

  * React component file name must include `-component`. Example: react-component.jsx.
  * Use SaSS (.scss) instead of css
  * Component folders must include a `.jsx` & `.scss` if component uses its own styles
